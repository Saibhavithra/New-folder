             Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value,
         either improvised or purposefully selected.Dance can be categorized and described by its 
         choreography, by its repertoire of movements or by its historical period or place of origin.
         Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and sometimes with the dancer simultaneously
         using a musical instrument themselves.
