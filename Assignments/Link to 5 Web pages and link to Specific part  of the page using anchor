        The performing arts are arts such as music, dance, and drama which are performed for an audience.
        They are different from the visual arts, which are the use of paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects.
        Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, including theatre, music, and dance.
