        Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages,
         is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka,
          Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music 
          that evolved from ancient Hindu texts and traditions, particularly the Samaveda.
          The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or 
          Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music;
          most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, 
          they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style
